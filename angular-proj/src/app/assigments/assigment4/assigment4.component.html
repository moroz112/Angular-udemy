<p appBasicDirective>1.	Create three new components: GameControl, Odd and Even</p>
<p>	2.	The GameControl Component should have buttons to start and stop the game</p>
<p>3.	When starting the game, an event (holding a incrementing number) should get emitted each second (ref = setInterval())</p>
<p>	4.	The event should be listenable from outside the component</p>
<p>	5.	When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted (clearInterval(ref))</p>
<p>	6.	A new Odd component should get created for every odd number emitted, the same should happen for the Even Component (on even numbers)</p>
<p>	7.	Simply output Odd - NUMBER or Even - NUMBER in the two components</p>
<p>	8.	Style the element (e.g. paragraph) holding your output text differently in both components</p>
